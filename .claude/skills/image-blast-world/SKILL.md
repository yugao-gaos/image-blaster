Create or resume one World Labs world for project `$0`.

## Instructions

- If `$0` is missing, ask for the world slug.
- Use `ls -a` before reading generated state.
- Use an explicit image path or prompt from `$ARGUMENTS` when provided.
- Without an explicit image, the world helper uses the highest-index visible image in `worlds/$0/source/`.
- Before generating, synthesize a prompt for the world that takes the original caption data we have and removes and objects we took out of the image. Use `worlds/$0/image.json` for the original scene description, then subtract all confirmed or explicitly removed objects from that description. Confirmed objects are `worlds/$0/output/<object>/object.json` files; use `object.name` and `object.description` to understand what to remove from the original scene description. 
- Treat the synthesized prompt as a text clean plate: preserve the original setting, materials, lighting, atmosphere, camera feel, and spatial layout, but describe the scene as an empty. Do not name, imply, or reintroduce removed objects, and do not reuse `imageJson.short_caption` directly.
- If the user specifically provides caption wording, apply the same subtraction rule before sending it. The World Labs prompt should describe the static empty environment, the "plate" environment, not the objects that were removed.
- The helper resumes unfinished `.N-world-request.json`, strips base64 before writing JSON, polls World Labs, writes `N-world.json`, and downloads every referenced world asset to matching `N-world*` files in `worlds/$0/output/world/`.
- The frontend must only load local files from disk. World Labs URLs in `N-world.json` are provenance/resume data only; never leave `.spz`, collider `.glb`, panorama, or thumbnail assets to be loaded from provider URLs.
- If any referenced `.spz`, collider, or panorama URL exists in `N-world.json`, make sure the matching local file is present before reporting success. Use the generic local asset tool on the matching `N-world.json` if files are missing.

```bash
node .claude/scripts/project/project-state.mjs --world "$0"
```

Run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/world/generate-world.mjs --world "$0" --prompt "<empty-environment world caption>"
```

Pass `--image` only when an explicit image path is provided or the selected source is not the helper default. Always pass `--prompt` with the synthesized empty-environment caption. For explicit regeneration, append `--regenerate`.

### Marble API flags

The helper exposes the full `marble-1.1` request surface. A concrete seed is always used and recorded in `N-world-request.json` (and the printed result), so a generation can be reproduced later even when `--seed` is omitted.

- `--seed <uint32>` — deterministic generation (0..4294967295). Omit to auto-generate and persist a random seed; reuse a recorded seed to regenerate a structurally similar world.
- `--is-pano` — treat the input `--image` as an equirectangular panorama (`image_prompt.is_pano: true`).
- `--disable-recaption` — skip Marble's prompt recaptioning (`world_prompt.disable_recaption: true`); useful when re-marbling a patch and you want the original framing preserved.
- `--multi-image "<path>@<azimuth>,<path>@<azimuth>,..."` — build a `multi-image` world_prompt from several views, each at its azimuth in degrees. Owns the prompt; `--image` is ignored in this mode.
- `--reconstruct-images` — with `--multi-image`, let Marble fuse the provided views (`reconstruct_images: true`).
- `--model <name>` — `marble-1.1` (default) or `marble-1.1-plus`.
- `--dry-run` — print the assembled request JSON (with the resolved seed) and exit without calling the API. Use to inspect the payload safely.

To fill missing local files from an existing world response, run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/project/ensure-local-assets.mjs --from "worlds/$0/output/world/<N>-world.json"
```

```bash
node .claude/scripts/project/project-state.mjs --world "$0"
```

Final response: report the source image used when relevant, the generation index, world output path, all downloaded `.glb`, `.spz`, panorama, and thumbnail paths if present, and any failure/resume metadata.
